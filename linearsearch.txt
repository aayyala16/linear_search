A linear search is the simplest method of searching a data set. Starting at the beginning of the data set, each item of data is examined until a match is made. Once the item is found, the search ends. If there is no match, the algorithm must deal with this.


algorithm :
Linear Search ( Array A, Value x)

Step 1: Set i to 1
Step 2: if i > n then go to step 7
Step 3: if A[i] = x then go to step 6
Step 4: Set i to i + 1
Step 5: Go to Step 2
Step 6: Print Element x Found at index i and go to step 8
Step 7: Print element not found
Step 8: Exit


Time complexity : 
best case is O(1)
worst case is o(n)
